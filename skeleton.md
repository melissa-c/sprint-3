What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to less than 550 px. How do you think that works?

The layout responds to the narrower width by reducing to one column of content, centres text, and only shows one hero image of the phone.

I think the layout works well in the narrower setting as the text is clear, the amount of unnecessary elements are reduced, and there's no need to scroll from side to side to view or read.

I think the skeleton css file causes the layout to change once the screen size is more than 550px. So the grid of preset column widths is not activated if the screen is less than 550px. I think the second phone image is set to not display until the screen size is larger than 550px.
