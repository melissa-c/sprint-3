What is your site's primary purpose?
It'll be a work in progress blog following my journey through the Dev experience and the things I've learned along the way. So it will be constantly changing as I use it to experiment with different layouts, etc as I dabble with coding.

Who is your target audience?
Newbie coders, web developers, graphic designers, students.

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?
I want the site to be really easy and frustration-free: easy to navigate and find things, easy to read and press buttons. The blogs should be able to be read independently of each other, but also easy to read one after the other.

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?
An anchored/absolute-positioned navigation menu will be at the top of every page. I'd like to have a search function anchored at the top right of every page. The interactive elements (buttons, links, etc) will have enough padding/space to be pressed on the mobile layout. There'll be back and next buttons on the blog pages so the blogs can be read in chronological order if desired.
